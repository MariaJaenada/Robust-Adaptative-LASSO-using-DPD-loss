# Robust-Adaptative-LASSO-using-DPD-loss
Code for fitting Linear Regression Models (LRM), using adaptative lasso based on the DPD loss procedure. This code was used to obtain the regression estimators in the paper "Robust adaptive variable selection in ultra-high dimensional linear regression models" (arXiv:2004.05470).
This code is based on the code implemented in https://github.com/cran/gamreg for Robust regression via gamma-divergence with L1, elastic net and ridge.
